=head1 NAME

Statistics::Descriptive::Smoother::Weigthedexponential - Implement weighted
exponential smoothing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Statistics::Descriptive::Smoother;
  my $smoother = Statistics::Descriptive::Smoother->instantiate({
           method   => 'weightedexponential',
           coeff    => 0.5,
           data     => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
           samples  => [110, 120, 130, 140, 150],
    });
  my @smoothed_data = $smoother->get_smoothed_data();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implement the weighted exponential smoothing algorithm to smooth
the trend of a series of statistical data.

This algorithm can help to control large swings in the unsmoothed data that
arise from small samples for those data points.

The algorithm implements the following formula:

W(0) = N(0)

W(t) = ( W(t-1) * CoeffA + N(t) * CoeffB ) / (CoeffA + CoeffB)

CoeffA = C * ( W(t-1) / (W(t-1) + N(t) ) )

CoeffB = (1 - C) * ( N(t) * (W(t-1) + N(t)) )


S(t) = (S(t-1)*CoeffA + X(t)*CoeffB) / (CoeffA + CoeffB)

where:

=over 3

=item * t = index in the series

=item * S(t) = smoothed series value at position t

=item * C = smoothing coefficient. Value in the [0;1] range. C<0> means that the series is not smoothed at all,
while C<1> the series is universally equal to the initial unsmoothed value.

=item * X(t) = unsmoothed series value at position t

=head1 METHODS

=over 5

=item $stats->get_smoothed_data();

Returns a copy of the smoothed data array.
