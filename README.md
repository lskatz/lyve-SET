lyve-SET
========

LYVE version of the Snp Extraction Tool (SET), a method of using hqSNPs to create a phylogeny.  Lyve-SET is meant to be run on a cluster but will just run system calls if qsub is not present.

NML, part of PHAC, has the original version of SET (https://github.com/apetkau).  However, I have been updating it since inception and so the results might differ slightly.

Installation
------------
* `make install`
* `make help` - for other `make` options
* See [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for more information including prerequisite software

For the impatient
-----------------
Here is a way to just try out the test dataset.

    set_test.pl lambda --numcpus 8 # or however many cpus you want
    set_test.pl listeria_monocytogenes --numcpus 8 # or another dataset

Make Lyve-SET go quickly with `--fast`!  This option is shorthand for several other options that save on computational time. See `launch_set.pl` usage below for more details.

    set_test.pl listeria_monocytogenes --numcpus 8 --fast

See: [examples.md](docs/EXAMPLES.md) for more details.  
Also see: [testdata.md](docs/TESTDATA.md) for more details on making your own test data set.

Usage
-----
To see the help for any script, run it without options or with `--help`.  For example, `set_test.pl -h`.  The following is the help for the main script, `launch_set.pl`:

    Usage: launch_set.pl [project] [-ref reference.fasta|reference.gbk]
    If project is not given, then it is assumed to be the current working directory.
    If reference is not given, then it is assumed to be proj/reference/reference.fasta
    -ref      proj/reference/reference.fasta   The reference genome assembly. If it is
                                               a genbank or embl file, then it will be
                                               converted to reference.gbk.fasta and will
                                               be used for SNP annotation. If a fasta
                                               is given, then no SNP annotation will
                                               happen. Using a gbk or embl file is currently
                                               experimental.

    SNP MATRIX OPTIONS
    --allowedFlanking  0               allowed flanking distance in bp. Nucleotides this close together cannot be considered as high-quality.
    --min_alt_frac     0.75  The percent consensus that needs to be reached before a SNP is called. Otherwise, 'N'
    --min_coverage     10  Minimum coverage needed before a SNP is called. Otherwise, 'N'

    Where parameters with a / are directories
    LOCATIONS OF FILE DIRECTORIES
    -reads    readsdir/       where fastq and fastq.gz files are located
    -bam      bamdir/         where to put bams
    -vcf      vcfdir/         where to put vcfs
    --tmpdir  tmpdir/         tmp/ Where to put temporary files
    --msadir  msadir/         multiple sequence alignment and tree files (final output)
    --logdir  logdir/         Where to put log files. Qsub commands are also stored here.
    -asm      asmdir/         directory of assemblies. Copy or symlink the reference genome assembly to use it if it is not already in the raw reads directory

    PERFORM CERTAIN STEPS
    --mask-phages                    Search for and mask phages in the reference genome
    --mask-cliffs                    Search for and mask 'Cliffs' in pileups

    SKIP CERTAIN STEPS
    --nomatrix                       Do not create an hqSNP matrix
    --nomsa                          Do not make a multiple sequence alignment
    --notrees                        Do not make phylogenies
    --singleend                      Treat everything like single-end. Useful for when you think there is a single-end/paired-end bias.
    OTHER SHORTCUTS
    --fast                           Shorthand for --downsample --mapper snap --nomask-phages --nomask-cliffs --sample-sites
    --presets ""                   See presets.conf for more information
    --downsample                     Downsample all reads to 50x. Approximated according to the ref genome assembly
    --sample-sites                   Randomly choose a genome and find SNPs in a quick and dirty way. Then on the SNP-calling stage, only interrogate those sites for SNPs for each genome (including the randomly-sampled genome).
    MODULES
    --read_cleaner  none              Which read cleaner?  Choices: none, CGP, BayesHammer
    --mapper        smalt             Which mapper? Choices: smalt, snap, stampy
    --snpcaller     varscan           Which variant filterer? Choice: varscan, vcftools
    SCHEDULER AND MULTITHREADING OPTIONS
    --queue         all.q             The default queue to use.
    --numnodes      50                maximum number of nodes
    --numcpus       1                 number of cpus
    --qsubxopts     '-N lyve-set'     Extra options to pass to qsub. This is not sanitized; internal options might overwrite yours.

Examples
------

See: [examples.md](docs/EXAMPLES.md) for more details.

The script `set_manage.pl` sets up the project directory and adds reads, and you should use the following syntax. Note that paired end reads should be in interleaved format. Scripts that interleave reads include `run_assembly_shuffleReads.pl` in the CG-Pipeline package (included with `make install`) and also `shuffleSequences_fastq.pl` in the Velvet package.

    # Shuffle your reads if they are not shuffled already.
    $ shuffleSplitReads.pl some/directory/*.fastq.gz -o interleaved # interleaved directory will be created for you
    # Create the project directory `setTest`
    $ set_manage.pl --create setTest
    # Add reads
    $ for i in interleaved/*.fastq.gz; do
    >   set_manage.pl setTest --add-reads $i
    > done;
    # Add assemblies (optional)
    $ set_manage.pl setTest --add-assembly file1.fasta
    $ set_manage.pl setTest --add-assembly file2.fasta
    # Specify your reference genome
    $ set_manage.pl setTest --change-reference file3.fasta


Run Lyve-SET with as few options as possible

    $ launch_set.pl setProj

More complex

    $ launch_set.pl setProj --queue all.q --numnodes 20 --numcpus 16 --noclean --notrees

Output files
------------
Most output files that you will want to see are under project/msa.  However for more details please see [docs/output.md](docs/OUTPUT.md).
